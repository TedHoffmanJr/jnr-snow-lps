## 3) Creative & Visual Ideas (feed 4:5, Stories/Reels 9:16, Nextdoor 1:1)

**Themes**

* **Community giveback**: neighbors, porch lights at dawn, “we’ve got you” tone.
* **Premium finish**: crisp driveway edges, no lawn tear, no curb rash.
* **Morning comfort**: coffee steam + clean driveway out the door.

**Static concepts (4:5 & 1:1)**

1. **Hero**: Clean driveway at sunrise; headline: “FREE Season Snow Removal — Enter Once, 3 Chances to Win.” Sub: “Cicero • Clay • Liverpool.”
2. **Before/After Split**: Left snowy, right pristine; small caption: “Up to \$500 value. Enter Today.”
3. **Edge Detail**: Tight crop of clean curb/edge; caption: “Cleaner than plows.”
4. **Mailbox & House #**: Suburban curb appeal; caption: “We’re giving back.”
5. **Ticket‑style Graphic**: “3 Drawing Dates” punches: 9/15 • 10/1 • 10/15.

**Reels/Stories (6–8s each)**

* **A) Problem → Payoff**: snow fall close‑up → quick cut to pristine driveway → CTA card: “Enter in 20s.”
* **B) Morning Vibe**: coffee steam → phone message “Driveway cleared” → CTA: Enter once; 3 drawings.
* **C) Finish Quality**: wheel rolling → clean edge macro → CTA: Up to \$500 value.

**On‑image overlays (keep short)**

* “FREE Season Snow Removal”
* “Enter Once → 3 Chances”
* “Cicero • Clay • Liverpool”
* “Drawings: 9/15 • 10/1 • 10/15”

**Alt text suggestions** (for accessibility)

* “A clean residential driveway at sunrise after snow removal; house lights are on.”
* “Split image showing heavy snow on one side and a fully cleared driveway on the other.”

## 4) Hashtags & Link Placement (practical answer)

* **Hashtags:** For local home services, hashtags provide **minimal incremental reach** on FB and modest on IG. Use **0–5** max, geo‑specific (e.g., #CiceroNY #ClayNY #LiverpoolNY #CNYWinter) if you like the look; otherwise skip—no harm.
* **Link placement:**

  * **Instagram feed:** link in bio + Story link stickers. Caption can say “Link in bio.”
  * **Facebook/Nextdoor:** put the **URL directly in the caption** (top lines). First‑comment link isn’t necessary.

---

## 5) Admin Notes (internal)

* Keep “must be in service area” in every post/footer.
* Do **not** say “new customers only”—**everyone is welcome**.
* Form is the **only** entry; comments for buzz only.
* Winner posts: first name + town only.
* Save all entries to shared Sheet; draw 1 per date.
